** Product: 1N4744A Zener Diode (15V)
** Source: Data from https://www.onsemi.com/download/data-sheet/pdf/1n4736at-d.pdf
** Note: Spice pin order and kicad pin order are reversed! 
** In Spice, pin 1 is anode and pin 2 is cathode.
** In KiCad, pin 1 is the cathode and pin 2 is the anode.
** For simulations, make sure to use Alternate node squence: 2 1
